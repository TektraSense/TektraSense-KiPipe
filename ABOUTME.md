### **About Me: A Craftsman's Approach to Development**

I'm a developer who enjoys the process of building things right. For me, good development is a craft that blends technical knowledge with a practical focus on creating solutions that are both effective and maintainable.

**Here are the principles that guide my work:**

* **Clarity & Simplicity:** I believe the best solutions are often the simplest ones. I strive to write clear, understandable code and design systems that are easy to reason about.
* **Reliability:** I focus on building robust systems that you can depend on, with a solid architectural foundation and careful error handling.
* **Maintainability:** I build for the long term. This means creating clean, organized code and clear documentation, making it easy for anyone—including my future self—to understand and build upon the work.

Whether I'm designing a PCB or building a data pipeline, my goal is always the same: to deliver a high-quality, professional result that solves the problem at hand and serves as a reliable foundation for what comes next.
